# AI Checklist

After hours of searching online for resources to learn AI, I have collated a curriculum to learn AI/ML. 

> After each course add a link of work to show your competence in the topic, the Work may include the following
>
> - 📑 Blog 
> - 📦 Personal project
> - 🐇 Participating in a competition
> - 👨‍💻 Open source contribution
