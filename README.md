# AI Checklist

After hours of searching online for resources to learn AI, I have collated a curriculum to learn AI/ML. 

> After each course add a link of work to show your competence in the topic, the Work may include the following
>
> - 📑 Blog 
> - 📦 Personal project
> - 🐇 Participating in a competition
> - 👨‍💻 Open source contribution

## Objective: Master the following
1. Computer science fundamentals – algorithms, data structures, computability, and complexity.
2. One or more programming language -> Python, C++, R, Java
3. Understanding of basic *Math, Stats and Probability* concepts
4. Pick your pokemon (start with one and capture the next one):  NLP, Computer Vision, Time series forcasting, Recommendation systems or Reinforcement learning. 
5. Distributed Computing
6. Big data
7. Deep learning
