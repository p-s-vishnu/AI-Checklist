# Useful things to remember

## mySQL [reference](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/)

- If the column is alpha numeric `c_1`, `c_10`, `c_2` will be the sorted order.
- Group by is NOT Case sensitive. eg: Sachin's use case 
- Count(Distinct) can help in finding per group count
- RIGHT(CITY, 1) in ('a','e') similar for left()
- CAST('2003-01-01' AS DATE) 
- ROUND (12345.54, -2), round to a left 

*Things to consider*
- Date functions and aggregation
- Regular expressions
- Lead and Lag
- Views in mysql
- Set a variable `SET @str = '12/31/2019';`
